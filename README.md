## Algorithm Details

### Graph Class (`graph.py`)

- **Adjacency Matrix**: N×N matrix for N vertices
- **O(1) Edge Lookup**: Constant time to check if edge exists
- **Degree Calculation**: Cached for efficiency
- **Connectivity Check**: BFS/DFS traversal in O(V²) time

### Eulerian Solver (`eulerian_solver.py`)

**Eulerian Circuit (Undirected)**:
- All vertices with edges have even degree
- Graph is connected

**Eulerian Path (Undirected)**:
- Exactly 2 vertices have odd degree
- Graph is connected

**Eulerian Circuit (Directed)**:
- All vertices have in-degree = out-degree
- Graph is weakly connected

**Eulerian Path (Directed)**:
- Exactly one vertex with out-degree - in-degree = 1 (start)
- Exactly one vertex with in-degree - out-degree = 1 (end)
- All other vertices have in-degree = out-degree

**Hierholzer's Algorithm**:
1. Start from appropriate vertex
2. Follow edges, removing them as you go
3. When stuck, backtrack and record vertices
4. Reverse the recorded sequence for final path
5. Time complexity: O(E) where E = number of edges

### MST Solver (`mst_solver.py`)

**Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
- A subset of edges forming a tree that connects all vertices
- Has exactly V-1 edges (for connected graph with V vertices)
- Minimizes total edge weight
- Acyclic (no cycles)
- Only for undirected graphs

**Kruskal's Algorithm**:
1. Sort all edges by weight (ascending)
2. Initialize Union-Find structure for cycle detection
3. For each edge in sorted order:
   - If edge connects different components, add to MST
   - Union the components
4. Stop when V-1 edges added or all edges processed
5. Time complexity: O(E log E) dominated by sorting

**Union-Find Data Structure**:
- **Path Compression**: Makes find() nearly O(1) amortized
- **Union by Rank**: Keeps trees balanced
- Overall amortized complexity: O(α(n)) where α is inverse Ackermann function
- Effectively constant time for practical purposes

**MST Properties**:
- Connected graph has exactly one MST (may have multiple with equal weights)
- Disconnected graph has Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF)
- Tree always has V-1 edges
- Removing any MST edge disconnects the tree
- Adding any non-MST edge creates exactly one cycle

### TSP Solver (`tsp_solver.py`)

**Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**:
- Find shortest tour visiting all vertices exactly once and returning to start
- NP-complete problem (no known polynomial-time exact algorithm)
- Only works on undirected weighted graphs

**Exact Algorithm - Held-Karp Dynamic Programming**:
1. Use bitmask DP to represent visited vertex subsets
2. dp[S][i] = minimum cost to visit all vertices in set S ending at i
3. Try all possible previous vertices for each state
4. Reconstruct optimal tour from DP table
5. Time complexity: O(n²·2ⁿ)
6. Space complexity: O(n·2ⁿ)
7. Practical for graphs with ≤15 vertices

**Nearest Neighbor Heuristic**:
1. Start at arbitrary vertex
2. Repeatedly visit nearest unvisited neighbor
3. Return to start after visiting all vertices
4. Time complexity: O(n²)
5. No approximation guarantee (can be arbitrarily bad)

**MST-Based 2-Approximation**:
1. Find MST using Kruskal's algorithm
2. Perform DFS traversal of MST to get pre-order
3. Use traversal order as tour (shortcut repeated vertices)
4. Time complexity: O(E log E)
5. Approximation ratio: ≤2× optimal (for metric TSP)

**Christofides 1.5-Approximation** (Simplified):
1. Find MST of the graph
2. Identify vertices with odd degree in MST
3. Find minimum weight perfect matching on odd vertices (simplified greedy)
4. Combine MST and matching to create Eulerian graph
5. Find Eulerian circuit
6. Convert to Hamiltonian by skipping repeated vertices
7. Time complexity: O(n³)
8. Approximation ratio: ≤1.5× optimal (for metric TSP)

**Auto Algorithm Selection**:
- Graphs ≤10 vertices: Use exact (Held-Karp)
- Graphs 11-20 vertices: Use Christofides
- Graphs >20 vertices: Use MST-approximation

### Hamiltonian Solver (`hamiltonian_solver.py`)

**Hamiltonian Path/Circuit**:
- Path: Visit all vertices exactly once
- Circuit: Visit all vertices exactly once and return to start
- NP-complete problem (even harder than TSP)
- Works on both directed and undirected graphs

**Theorem-Based Detection** (Undirected graphs only):

**Dirac's Theorem** (Sufficient condition):
- If deg(v) ≥ n/2 for all vertices v
- Then Hamiltonian circuit exists
- Provides O(V) check before expensive search

**Ore's Theorem** (Sufficient condition):
- If deg(u) + deg(v) ≥ n for all non-adjacent vertices u, v
- Then Hamiltonian circuit exists
- More general than Dirac's theorem

**Backtracking Algorithm**:
1. Try all possible paths systematically
2. Use DFS with backtracking
3. Prune branches that cannot lead to solution
4. Sort neighbors by degree (visit low-degree vertices first)
5. Time complexity: O(n!) worst case
6. Timeout protection (default 5 seconds)

**Optimizations**:
- Early termination when path found
- Degree-based vertex ordering heuristic
- Configurable timeout to prevent excessive computation
- TSP reduction for complete graphs (optional)

**Path vs Circuit Mode**:
- Path search: Try starting from each vertex
- Circuit search: Only need to try from vertex 0 (symmetry)
- Circuit-only mode: Reject paths that don't return to start

## Examples

### Example 1: Pentagon (Eulerian Circuit)

```python
from graph import Graph
from eulerian_solver import solve_eulerian

# Create pentagon graph
graph = Graph(5, directed=False)
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)]
for u, v in edges:
    graph.add_edge(u, v)

# Analyze

print(result)
# Output: Eulerian Circuit exists: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0
```

### Example 2: Path Graph (Eulerian Path)

```python
# Create path with exactly 2 odd-degree vertices
graph = Graph(5, directed=False)
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 3)]
for u, v in edges:
    graph.add_edge(u, v)

result = solve_eulerian(graph)
print(result)
# Output: Eulerian Path exists (start: 0): 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
```

graph.add_edge(0, 1, weight=1)
graph.add_edge(1, 2, weight=2)
graph.add_edge(2, 3, weight=3)
graph.add_edge(3, 0, weight=4)
graph.add_edge(0, 2, weight=5)

# Find MST
result = solve_mst(graph)
print(result)
# Output: MST exists: 3 edges, total weight: 6
#         Edges: (0,1):1, (1,2):2, (2,3):3
```

### Example 4: Traveling Salesman Problem

graph.add_edge(0, 1, weight=10)
graph.add_edge(0, 2, weight=15)
graph.add_edge(0, 3, weight=20)
graph.add_edge(1, 2, weight=35)
graph.add_edge(1, 3, weight=25)
graph.add_edge(2, 3, weight=30)

# Find optimal TSP tour
result = solve_tsp(graph, algorithm="exact")
print(result)
# Output: TSP tour found using exact (Held-Karp) (optimal)
#         Distance: 80
#         Path: 0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 0

# Use approximation for larger graphs
result_approx = solve_tsp(graph, algorithm="mst_approximation")
print(f"Approximation ratio: {result_approx.approximation_ratio}")
# Output: Approximation ratio: 2.0
```

### Example 5: Hamiltonian Path/Circuit

```python
from graph import Graph
from hamiltonian_solver import solve_hamiltonian

# Create graph with Hamiltonian circuit
graph = Graph(4, directed=False)
graph.add_edge(0, 1)
graph.add_edge(1, 2)
graph.add_edge(2, 3)
graph.add_edge(3, 0)

# Find Hamiltonian circuit
result = solve_hamiltonian(graph, circuit_only=True)
print(result)
# Output: Hamiltonian circuit found using backtracking
#         Path: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 0

# Check using Dirac's theorem on complete graph
complete_graph = Graph(5, directed=False)
for i in range(5):
    for j in range(i+1, 5):
        complete_graph.add_edge(i, j)

result = solve_hamiltonian(complete_graph)
# Uses Dirac's theorem (all vertices have degree ≥ n/2)
print(result.reason)
# Output: Dirac's theorem satisfied (min degree 4 ≥ 2.5)
```
