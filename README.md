## Algorithm Details

### Graph Class (`graph.py`)

- **Adjacency Matrix**: N×N matrix for N vertices
- **O(1) Edge Lookup**: Constant time to check if edge exists
- **Degree Calculation**: Cached for efficiency
- **Connectivity Check**: BFS/DFS traversal in O(V²) time

### Eulerian Solver (`eulerian_solver.py`)

**Eulerian Circuit (Undirected)**:
- All vertices with edges have even degree
- Graph is connected

**Eulerian Path (Undirected)**:
- Exactly 2 vertices have odd degree
- Graph is connected

**Eulerian Circuit (Directed)**:
- All vertices have in-degree = out-degree
- Graph is weakly connected

**Eulerian Path (Directed)**:
- Exactly one vertex with out-degree - in-degree = 1 (start)
- Exactly one vertex with in-degree - out-degree = 1 (end)
- All other vertices have in-degree = out-degree

**Hierholzer's Algorithm**:
1. Start from appropriate vertex
2. Follow edges, removing them as you go
3. When stuck, backtrack and record vertices
4. Reverse the recorded sequence for final path
5. Time complexity: O(E) where E = number of edges

### MST Solver (`mst_solver.py`)

**Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)**:
- A subset of edges forming a tree that connects all vertices
- Has exactly V-1 edges (for connected graph with V vertices)
- Minimizes total edge weight
- Acyclic (no cycles)
- Only for undirected graphs

**Kruskal's Algorithm**:
1. Sort all edges by weight (ascending)
2. Initialize Union-Find structure for cycle detection
3. For each edge in sorted order:
   - If edge connects different components, add to MST
   - Union the components
4. Stop when V-1 edges added or all edges processed
5. Time complexity: O(E log E) dominated by sorting

**Union-Find Data Structure**:
- **Path Compression**: Makes find() nearly O(1) amortized
- **Union by Rank**: Keeps trees balanced
- Overall amortized complexity: O(α(n)) where α is inverse Ackermann function
- Effectively constant time for practical purposes

**MST Properties**:
- Connected graph has exactly one MST (may have multiple with equal weights)
- Disconnected graph has Minimum Spanning Forest (MSF)
- Tree always has V-1 edges
- Removing any MST edge disconnects the tree
- Adding any non-MST edge creates exactly one cycle

## Examples

### Example 1: Pentagon (Eulerian Circuit)

```python
from graph import Graph
from eulerian_solver import solve_eulerian

# Create pentagon graph
graph = Graph(5, directed=False)
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (4, 0)]
for u, v in edges:
    graph.add_edge(u, v)

# Analyze
result = solve_eulerian(graph)
print(result)
# Output: Eulerian Circuit exists: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 0
```

### Example 2: Path Graph (Eulerian Path)

```python
# Create path with exactly 2 odd-degree vertices
graph = Graph(5, directed=False)
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4), (1, 3)]
for u, v in edges:
    graph.add_edge(u, v)

result = solve_eulerian(graph)
print(result)
# Output: Eulerian Path exists (start: 0): 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 3 -> 4
```

### Example 3: Minimum Spanning Tree

```python
from graph import Graph
from mst_solver import solve_mst

# Create weighted graph
graph = Graph(4, directed=False)
graph.add_edge(0, 1, weight=1)
graph.add_edge(1, 2, weight=2)
graph.add_edge(2, 3, weight=3)
graph.add_edge(3, 0, weight=4)
graph.add_edge(0, 2, weight=5)

# Find MST
result = solve_mst(graph)
print(result)
# Output: MST exists: 3 edges, total weight: 6
#         Edges: (0,1):1, (1,2):2, (2,3):3
```

### Example 4: Using GUI

1. Launch GUI: `python main.py`
2. Set number of vertices (e.g., 5)
3. Select graph type (Undirected for MST)
4. Select analysis type (Eulerian/Chinese Postman/MST)
5. Enter adjacency matrix values (use weights for MST)
6. Click "Analyze Graph"
7. View results with degree info and Eulerian validity
8. Optionally export results to file

Or use the "Load Example" buttons for quick demonstrations.
