# Circuit-Only Mode Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully added a new feature to the Eulerian Graph Analyzer that allows users to constrain the algorithm to find only Eulerian circuits (paths that return to the starting vertex), rather than accepting any Eulerian path.

## Changes Made

### 1. Core Algorithm Updates - `eulerian_solver.py`

#### Modified Methods:

**`EulerianSolver.analyze(circuit_only: bool = False)`**
- Added `circuit_only` parameter to control search behavior
- Passes the constraint to both undirected and directed analysis methods
- Default is `False` to maintain backward compatibility

**`EulerianSolver._analyze_undirected(circuit_only: bool = False)`**
- Added logic to reject graphs with only Eulerian paths when `circuit_only=True`
- When circuit-only mode is active and graph has exactly 2 odd-degree vertices:
  - Returns `has_path=False` and `has_circuit=False`
  - Provides clear reason message explaining the constraint
- When circuit-only mode is off, behavior is unchanged

**`EulerianSolver._analyze_directed(circuit_only: bool = False)`**
- Added logic to reject graphs with only Eulerian paths when `circuit_only=True`
- When circuit-only mode is active and graph has start/end vertices (path but no circuit):
  - Returns `has_path=False` and `has_circuit=False`
  - Provides clear reason message explaining the constraint
- When circuit-only mode is off, behavior is unchanged

#### Behavior Matrix:

| Graph Type | Normal Mode | Circuit-Only Mode |
|------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Has Eulerian Circuit | Finds circuit | Finds circuit |
| Has Eulerian Path only | Finds path | Rejects (no result) |
| No Eulerian path/circuit | Rejects | Rejects |

### 2. User Interface Updates - `gui.py`

#### New UI Control:

Added a radio button group in the "Graph Settings" section with two options:
- **"Path or Circuit"** (default): Finds any Eulerian path or circuit
- **"Circuit Only"**: Only finds Eulerian circuits (path must return to start)

#### Location in UI:
- Added below the "Graph Type" (Directed/Undirected) selection
- Includes helpful tooltip text: "(Circuit: path must return to start)"

#### New Instance Variables:
- `self.circuit_only`: Boolean flag tracking the selected mode
- `self.circuit_only_var`: tkinter BooleanVar for the radio button

#### New Method:
**`_on_mode_changed()`**
- Handler for mode selection changes
- Updates `self.circuit_only` when user toggles the radio buttons

#### Modified Methods:

**`__init__()`**
- Added `self.circuit_only = False` initialization

**`_create_control_section()`**
- Added new radio button group for search mode selection
- Added tooltip label explaining circuit mode

**`_analyze_graph()`**
- Now passes `circuit_only=self.circuit_only` to `solver.analyze()`

**`_display_results()`**
- Now shows "Search Mode" in the results output
- Displays either "Circuit Only" or "Path or Circuit" based on selection
- Enhanced messages for circuit-only mode failures
- Added circuit verification message when circuit is found in circuit-only mode

### 3. Test Suite - `test_circuit_mode.py`

Created comprehensive test file with 4 test cases:

1. **Test 1**: Circuit-only mode with graph that has Eulerian circuit
   - Tests pentagon (cycle graph)
   - Verifies both modes find the circuit

2. **Test 2**: Circuit-only mode with graph that has only Eulerian path
   - Tests pentagon with extra edge (2 odd-degree vertices)
   - Verifies normal mode finds path, circuit-only mode rejects

3. **Test 3**: Circuit-only mode with directed graph that has Eulerian circuit
   - Tests directed cycle
   - Verifies both modes find the circuit

4. **Test 4**: Circuit-only mode with directed graph that has only Eulerian path
   - Tests directed path with branches
   - Verifies normal mode finds path, circuit-only mode rejects

## Files Modified

## Usage Instructions

### For Users:

1. Launch the application:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. In the GUI, under "Graph Settings", you'll see a new "Search Mode" option

3. Select your preferred mode:
   - **"Path or Circuit"** (default): Will find any Eulerian path, including circuits
   - **"Circuit Only"**: Will only accept graphs with Eulerian circuits

4. Create your graph using the adjacency matrix or load an example

5. Click "Analyze Graph"

6. Results will show:
   - The selected search mode
   - Whether a circuit/path was found
   - Detailed explanation including constraint information if circuit-only mode rejected a path

### For Developers:

Using the circuit-only mode programmatically:

```python
from graph import Graph
from eulerian_solver import EulerianSolver

# Create a graph
graph = Graph(5, directed=False)
# ... add edges ...

# Analyze with normal mode (default)
solver = EulerianSolver(graph)
result_normal = solver.analyze(circuit_only=False)

# Analyze with circuit-only mode
result_circuit = solver.analyze(circuit_only=True)

# Check results
if result_circuit.has_circuit:
    print(f"Found circuit: {result_circuit.path}")
else:
    print(f"No circuit found: {result_circuit.reason}")
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Pentagon Graph (Cycle)
- **Graph**: 5 vertices in a cycle (0-1-2-3-4-0)
- **All vertices have degree 2 (even)**
- **Normal mode**: Finds Eulerian circuit
- **Circuit-only mode**: Finds Eulerian circuit
- **Result**: Both modes succeed

### Scenario 2: Pentagon with Extra Edge
- **Graph**: Pentagon plus edge 1-4
- **Vertices 1 and 4 have degree 3 (odd), others degree 2**
- **Normal mode**: Finds Eulerian path from vertex 1 to vertex 4
- **Circuit-only mode**: Rejects with message "Circuit-only mode: Graph has 2 vertices with odd degree (1, 4) - only Eulerian path exists, not a circuit"
- **Result**: Normal mode succeeds, circuit-only mode rejects

## Backward Compatibility

All changes maintain full backward compatibility:
- The `circuit_only` parameter defaults to `False`
- Existing code calling `solver.analyze()` without parameters will work unchanged
- Default UI mode is "Path or Circuit" (same as previous behavior)
- All existing functionality is preserved

## Error Messages

The feature provides clear, informative error messages:

**Undirected graph with path-only in circuit mode:**
```
Circuit-only mode: Graph has 2 vertices with odd degree (1, 4) - only Eulerian path exists, not a circuit
```

**Directed graph with path-only in circuit mode:**
```
Circuit-only mode: Graph has start vertex (0) and end vertex (4) - only Eulerian path exists, not a circuit
```

## Testing

To run the circuit-only mode test suite:

```bash
python test_circuit_mode.py
```

Expected output:
```

## Technical Details

### Algorithm Complexity
- No change to time complexity: Still O(E) for path finding
- Minimal overhead: Only adds degree-checking condition
- Space complexity unchanged: O(V + E)

### Key Design Decisions

1. **Parameter-based approach**: Used optional parameter instead of separate method to keep API clean
2. **Early rejection**: Reject path-only graphs before running Hierholzer's algorithm to save computation
3. **Clear messaging**: Provide detailed reasons for rejection to help users understand constraints
4. **UI placement**: Placed mode selector near graph type for logical grouping
5. **Default behavior**: Defaults to permissive mode (path or circuit) to maintain existing behavior

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:
- Add keyboard shortcuts for mode switching
- Add visual indicator in graph visualization for circuit vs path
- Add option to auto-convert path graphs to circuits (by adding/suggesting edges)
- Add statistics showing circuit probability for random graphs

## Summary

This feature successfully adds circuit-only constraint capability to the Eulerian Graph Analyzer while:
- Maintaining full backward compatibility
- Providing clear user feedback
- Following existing code patterns and style
- Including comprehensive test coverage
- Documenting changes thoroughly

The implementation is production-ready and preserves all existing functionality while adding powerful new constraint options for users.
